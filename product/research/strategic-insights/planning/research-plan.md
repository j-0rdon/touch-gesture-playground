# Strategic Insights Discovery Plan

**Purpose:** Systematically uncover strategic-level insights from the User Roles work that could inform product strategy, positioning, and prioritisation.

## 1. Pattern Analysis

### 1.1 Struggling Moments Clustering
Review all struggling moments across roles. Look for:
- Common root causes (what breaks most often?)
- Cascade failures (one role's struggle → another role's struggle → guest impact)
- Frequency × severity matrix (which struggles matter most?)

**Output:** Prioritised problem themes

### 1.2 Information Flow Mapping
Trace how information moves between roles:
- Reservationist → Host (handoff quality)
- Host → Server (what gets communicated?)
- Guest → System → Staff (how do guest needs travel?)

**Output:** Identify where information gets lost or degraded

### 1.3 Key Moments Overlap
Map key moments across roles to the same timeline (e.g., "Saturday 7pm"):
- Who is under pressure simultaneously?
- Where do competing priorities create conflict?
- What's happening to the guest at each moment?

**Output:** Critical intersection points

---

## 2. Guest Experience Chain Analysis

### 2.1 End-to-End Journey Mapping
Map the guest journey against staff touchpoints:
- Booking → Confirmation → Reminder → Arrival → Seating → Service → Departure
- At each stage: which role owns it? What can go wrong? What makes it great?

**Output:** Experience chain with failure points and moments of delight

### 2.2 Trust Accumulation Model
How does trust build (or erode) across the journey?
- First-time guest: what signals build confidence?
- Returning guest: what makes them feel known?
- Group organiser: what makes them look good?

**Output:** Trust levers by guest type

### 2.3 Recovery Opportunities
When things go wrong, where can staff recover the experience?
- Which failures are recoverable vs. fatal?
- What tools/information would enable recovery?

**Output:** Recovery intervention points

---

## 3. Role Relationship Analysis

### 3.1 Dependency Mapping
Which roles depend on which?
- Hard dependencies (can't function without)
- Soft dependencies (better with, but can work around)

**Output:** Dependency graph with criticality ratings

### 3.2 Handoff Quality
Examine each role-to-role handoff:
- What information should transfer?
- What actually transfers today?
- What's the cost of a bad handoff (to guest)?

**Output:** Handoff quality gaps

### 3.3 Misaligned Incentives
Where might role motivations conflict?
- Host wants to seat fast vs. Server wants steady pacing
- Reservationist wants full book vs. Host wants buffer
- GM wants covers vs. Kitchen wants predictability

**Output:** Tension points requiring system design

## 4. Market & Competitive Lens

### 4.1 Segment-Specific Needs
How do needs differ by restaurant type?
- Fine Dining: recognition, personalisation, occasion delivery
- Casual Dining: speed, group handling, turn efficiency
- Polished Casual: blend of both

**Output:** Segment-specific priority matrix

### 4.2 Competitive Positioning Gaps
What do existing solutions optimise for?
- OpenTable: inventory, demand gen
- Resy: premium/cool factor
- SevenRooms: CRM/guest data

Where is guest experience underserved?

**Output:** Positioning whitespace

### 4.3 Switching Triggers
What makes a venue switch reservation systems?
- Host frustration? GM mandate? Guest complaints?
- What's the "last straw" moment?

**Output:** Switching trigger hypotheses (for validation)

---

## 5. Synthesis Methods

### 5.1 "Jobs Chain" Construction
Build the chain: Reservationist job → Host job → Server job → Guest outcome
- Where does the chain break most often?
- What's the weakest link?

### 5.2 Leverage Point Identification
Using the above, identify:
- High-leverage interventions (small input, big outcome)
- Force multipliers (helps multiple roles simultaneously)
- Defensive necessities (table stakes, must not fail)

### 5.3 Strategic Hypothesis Generation
From patterns, generate hypotheses like:
- "If we solve X for the Host, Y improves for the Guest"
- "The real competition isn't other reservation systems, it's Z"
- "Venues buy for A but stay for B"

---

## 6. Validation Approach

For each insight, define:
- **Confidence level:** High (data-backed) / Medium (pattern-supported) / Low (hypothesis)
- **Validation method:** Contextual inquiry / Analytics / Survey / Stakeholder interview
- **Risk if wrong:** What do we build incorrectly if this insight is false?

## Suggested Sequence

1. Start with Struggling Moments Clustering (1.1) — quick, high-signal
2. Then Guest Experience Chain (2.1) — connects roles to outcome
3. Then Handoff Quality (3.2) — where value leaks
4. Then Leverage Points (5.2) — synthesis into action

---

**Next step:** Execute section 1.1 (Struggling Moments Clustering) and discuss findings before proceeding.

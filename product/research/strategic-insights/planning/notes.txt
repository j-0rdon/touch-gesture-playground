# Draft Insights from Another Claude - TO REVIEW

1. Information degradation is the core failure mode
Across struggling moments, the same pattern: information exists but doesn't travel. Guest notes written but not read. VIP status known but not surfaced. Party size changed but update lost. The product isn't really a "reservation system" — it's an information delivery system that happens to manage bookings.
2. The handoff is the product
Reservationist → Host is the critical seam. If that handoff fails, all the careful book-building is wasted. Yet most systems treat this as implicit. There might be a distinct product opportunity in making that handoff explicit and excellent.
3. Host as leading indicator
If Host friction predicts guest experience, then Host sentiment/friction metrics could be a proxy for guest experience quality. This reframes analytics: don't just track covers and revenue — track Host experience as a leading indicator.
4. Competitors optimise for the wrong user
OpenTable, Resy, SevenRooms — they optimise for Reservationist (book-building), GM (reporting), or Guest (discovery/booking). But the Host — the highest-frequency, highest-stakes user — is underserved. "Win the Host" isn't just internal prioritisation; it could be market positioning.
5. Recognition is a differentiator
"Feel known" appears across Guest: Returning, GM jobs, and Server needs. But it requires context to flow seamlessly. Most systems store guest data; few surface it at the right moment. This is the gap between CRM and hospitality.
6. The real product is cascade interruption
Problems cascade: late arrival → rushed seating → overwhelmed server → kitchen spike → poor guest experience. A strategic frame could be: predict and interrupt cascades before they reach the guest. This shifts from reactive tooling to proactive orchestration.
7. Recovery as design principle
Things will go wrong. The question is whether staff can recover gracefully. This is underexplored in the current doc — we have "struggling moments" but not "recovery moments." Could be worth adding.
